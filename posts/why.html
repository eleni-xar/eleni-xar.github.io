        <p>This short post aims to explain why mathematics and programming are fascinating, and it is worth it that you spend your time to explore their world.</p>
<p>So, why learn maths and programming? Because it is fun. After all, fun is the only convincing reason for studying anything. When we enjoy something, learning becomes a delightful adventure. Otherwise, we get bored, disengaged, and any learning – if it happens at all – is compromised. The good news is that both programming and maths can be incredibly fun. (In fact, maths and programming are similar in many aspects, and from now on, I will use maths+ when I want to refer to both of them).</p>
<p>I suspect that most of you don’t have a problem believing me when I claim that programming is fun. After all, with programming, one can create many cool things such as images, animations, scripts that control electronic gadgets, etc. But ‘maths’? This word sends shivers down the spine of many people.</p>
<p>This negative reaction to mathematics usually stems from unhappy experiences with the subject at school and is not surprising. In school, mathematics more often than not gets diminished to a set of dry, seemingly meaningless rules. However, maths is much more than this, and it is a shame that only a few students get a glimpse of its beauty while at school.</p>
<p>Maths+ is a creative art like music. Musicians choose and combine sounds to compose harmonious melodies. Mathematicians (programmers) put together expressions written in mathematics or some programming language to find solutions for fascinating problems. Both in maths+ and music there are rules. Nevertheless, their purpose is only to provide a guiding framework which guarantees that the result will be orderly and harmonious.</p>
<p>You may wish that I list for you a bunch of mathematical applications that are interesting, but I won’t. Still, it is needless to say that computers wouldn’t even exist without maths. So if programming has fascinating applications, then so does maths.</p>
<p>In the end, the thrill doesn’t lie with any particular application, but with the endless possibility of creativity. Imagine that you are a painter, and you have in front of you an empty canvas. You can do pretty much whatever you want, and your tools allow you. The same is the case with a mathematician or a programmer. The only caveat is that if you are to create something great, you need to know your tools very well. And this is what I hope to offer to you through this blog: the tools that you need to be able to start playing with maths+ according to your desires.</p>
<p>In the process, there may be bits that seem tedious or boring. But then again, this is pretty much the case with anything to which we apply ourselves seriously. If you do a sport, you will know that it is not only about playing, it is also about training. The same is true when you are learning a musical instrument. Maths+ is no different. And in all cases, the result is worth it. So let’s get our hands dirty and dive into the art of maths+.</p>
