<p>We both love maths and Computer Science (CS). We have fun programming and solving mathematical problems. Doing this we have come to realise how closely related the two fields are. Programming can be used to solve mathematical problems and investigate mathematical properties, while mathematics can be used to create programs but also understand the fundamental aspects of computation and programming. It seems a match made in heaven, and this blog is meant to prove it. In the meantime, we hope that you will learn some programming, get a better grasp of mathematical concepts, but most of all have fun with problem solving.</p>

<p><strong>Eleni:</strong>I have a solid mathematical background with a particular interest in the mathematics of computer science. I combine this knowledge with a deep understanding of modern pedagogical theories, which I acquired during my PhD in Mathematics Education. During that time, I also had the opportunity to teach elementary programming skills to children, and to participate in projects developing mathematics educational material at the University of Cambridge. Currently, I study to improve my programming skills.</p>

<p><strong>Rohit:</strong> I have 19 years of experience working at startups and larger technology companies doing research and engineering in distributed filesystems, embedded systems (IoT), and, more recently, back-end engineering using functional programming. I have taught computer science, mathematics, and programming at the undergraduate level and in schools. Currently, I conduct interviews to select top-tier candidates for technical jobs and engage in research to promote computer programming.</p>
