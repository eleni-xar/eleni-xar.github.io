.right-column[
Linux is an **operating system**.

It is software that enables applications and the
user to access devices (mouse, printer, filesystem, network, etc.).

# Road System
]

.right-column[
People can build private roads within their property, but they
still need to:

- Connect these to the shared road network.

- Agree on a road code.

- Agree on a method to enforce rules.

The road code and its enforcement is analogous to an operating
system.

  1a. Preheat oven to 180 °C.

  1b. Grease and flour baking pans.

  1c. Beat butter and sugar until fluffy. 

  2c. Combine flour and baking powder in a bowl. Pour mixture into the batter.

  3a. Bake in preheated oven, 30 to 35 minutes.

A chef in the kitchen is analogous to the operating system,
translating the abstractions into particulars as needed.

 ## What is an OS?
]
.right-column[

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer
hardware, software resources, and provides common services for
computer programs.

# An OS is also software

<!-- - It is described similar to the baking recipe, except that it must
take responsibility for everything directly. -->

- That means that the chef in our kitchen is also a recipe, one that can execute itself and must take responsibility for everything directly

# More than just an OS

Early Unix developers were highly skilled mathematicians, engineers and in a sense even philosophers.

- Unix established a set of cultural norms for developing software
  - modularity
  - reusability

These norms have become as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself.

# Other Operating Systems

- The dominant desktop operating system is Windows
  - owned by Microsoft
  - 1985
  - growing interest in graphical user interfaces
  - graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS

- second in populairy comes macOS, 
  - owned by Apple
  - 1984
  - series of graphical operating systems
  - evolved out of UNIX

- The varieties of Linux are collectively in third place.
  - 1991
  - a version of UNIX for PC

# Initial days of Linux

- for a long time, Linux was popular only amongst hobbyists
  - text based interface

.center[<img src="../images/linux-presentation/textInterface.png" width="40%" />]

- took off seriously in the mid 1990s
 - NASA
 - suprecomputing community
 - affordable solution

- commercial use began when Dell and IBM, started offering Linux
support to escape the monopoly of Microsoft.

Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention "Freax", a portmanteau
of "free", "freak", and "x" (as an allusion to Unix)

# Free Software

Not to be confused with Freeware.

Free software is computer software distributed under terms that allow
users:

- The freedom to run the program for any purpose (freedom 0).

- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it (freedom 1).  
  - Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom 2).

- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).

Free software is a matter of liberty, not price! 

<!-- -- all users are legally free to do what they want with their copies of a free software (including profiting from them) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program. ---->

---

# Practical Demonstration of Open Source


1. someone puts up a project on the internet
1. someone else notices the potential for an improvement.
1. the collaborator makes a change using a copy of the code
1. the collaborator submits the change as a request to merge work
1. the original author, or anyone else with privileges, reviews the
submitted work and eventually accepts it.

---

# Open Source and the GNU Project

- UNIX was developed and shared freely amongst the early users

- Slowly, license restrictions crept in to control freedoms.

.center[<img src="../images/linux-presentation/Richard_Stallman_2019.jpeg" width="30%" />]

- Richard Stallman starting the free-software movement in 1983

- GNU Project
 - a collaborative effort to create a freedom-respecting operating system
 - to revive the spirit of cooperation once prevalent among hackers.

---

# Copyleft <img src="../images/linux-presentation/Copyleft-white.png" width="7%" />

- A legal mechanism to protect the rights for free software.

- Right to freely distribute and modify intellectual property. 

- The same rights are preserved in derivative works created from that property.

- Information for reproducing and modifying the work is available, commonly as source code.


---

# Motivations for Free Software Developers

First example in history where humans across the globe
  - collaborated to successfully to create solutions.
  - without central oversight or monetary incentive.
  - and the solutions have excelled in quality.

What is the motivation?

- work fills some particular need
- respect of peers
- sense of contribution and community
- boost skills and resume

# Linux as free software

Linux comprises:

  - a core piece, called the kernel (originating from Linus Torvalds)
  - GNU tools and libraries
  - additional software
  - documentation
  - and a graphical desktop environment. 

Most of the included software is free and open-source software.
<!-- -- made available both as compiled binaries and in source code form, allowing modifications to the original software. ---->

---

# Linux as free software

- Linux kernel is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
version 2.
  - any software using the kernel must make the original source code and any modifications available to the recipient
  - the same terms apply to the recipient.

- GPL has been incorrectly called a 'virus'. 

- Richard Stallman responded this view with an analogy:
   - "The GPL's domain does not spread by proximity or contact,
   - only by deliberate inclusion of GPL-covered code in your program."

---

# Disadvantages of non-free platforms

- platform lock-in

- no way to study or modify solutions without vendor participation

- solutions tend to be non-modular, complicated, and expensive

- no oversight

- leads to duplication of human effort

.footnote[Note: these is a matter of opinion]

# Linux Today

- Linux is used throughout computing, from embedded
systems to virtually all supercomputers.

- It is supported by big names, such as IBM, Google, Sun, Oracle, Dell and many more.
 
- Customised Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market. 

<!-- -- with many devices shipping with  customised Linux distributions
installed, and Google releasing their own Chrome OS designed for
netbooks. ---->

- The greatest success is perhaps the mobile device market, with Android  operating systems on smartphones, tablets and wearables. 

- Linux gaming is also on the rise. 

- Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and
national governments.

---

# Linux Distributions

- Linus Torvalds distributed the first version of Linux as source code
only, and later as a pair of downloadable floppy disk images.

- The installation procedure was complicated and distributions sprang up to
simplify this.

- Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one
of the Linux distributions.

- A Linux distribution is essentially a particular
assortment of applications and utility software packaged together with the Linux kernel.

- Distributions are normally segmented into packages. Each package
contains a specific application or service.

- Packages can be installed or removed using a package manager, which simplifies dependency management.

---

# Suggested Linux Distribution

Among the widely used GNU-based distributions, we suggest:

- Debian, a non-commercial distribution and one of the earliest, maintained by a volunteer developer community.

<!-- -- with a strong commitment to free software principles and democratic project management. ---->

- Ubuntu, a desktop and server distribution derived from Debian,
maintained by the British company Canonical Ltd.

Other popular distributions include RedHat, Fedora, and SuSE

---

# Benefits of Using Linux

- Linux systems are extremely stable.

- Free; no need to pay for licenses.

- Persistent high performance.

- Reliable security; near absence of viruses

- Low resource requirements, hence less expensive systems.

- Continues to work well even after the disk gets completely full;
Linux never gets slow.

- Large number of organizations support it.

- Graphical interface, user-Friendly installation, and equivalents for
most applications.

---

# False Myths about Linux

- Too difficult for ordinary people to use.

- Less secure because the source code is available to anybody.

- Most jobs require Microsoft, so why bother.

- Linux is free, therefore, there is no way for businesses to make money from it.

- Linux is a type of software piracy, because much was copied from other operating systems.

# Rohit's initial use of Linux

- Experiment with software design and operating systems.

- Study software and modify it to suit needs.

- In many cases, Linux would not run smoothly
  - spent significant amounts of time tweaking things to
get them to work.

It was all great fun, but somewhat frustrating.
