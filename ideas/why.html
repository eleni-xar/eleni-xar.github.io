        <p>Why learn maths and programming? The main reason is: Because it is fun. After all, fun is the only good reason to learn anything. When we enjoy something, we learn better. Otherwise, we get bored, disengaged and any learning – if it happens at all – is compromised. The good news is that both programming and maths can be incredibly fun. (In fact, maths and programming are similar in many aspects, and from now on, I will use math(ematic)s+ when I want to refer to both of them).</p>
<p>I suspect that most of you don’t have a problem believing me when I claim that programming is fun, but I would guess that many of you would think that I am crazy to suggest the same for maths. After all, with programming, one can create many cool things such as images, animations, scripts that control electronic gadgets, etc. But ‘maths’? This word often sends shivers down the spine of many people. Not all of you – thank God, there are still geeks out there. Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>(By the way, there is nothing wrong with geeks; they are some of the loveliest people on earth. They are only blessed to be very passionate about what they are doing, and of course, their passion comes from enjoying what they do. Also all the geeks I know are friendly, they may not be renowned for their social skills, but if you get the time to know them, I guarantee you will not regret it.)</p>
<h2 id="rules-and-creativity">Rules and creativity</h2>
<p>Anyway, back to the rest of the world who have been misled to believe that maths is a drag. <span class="text-danger">Disclosure:</span> <strong>Nothing</strong> is further from the truth. This widespread prejudice against mathematics is an unfortunate error, stemming from unhappy experiences with the subject at school. <span class="text-danger">Disclaimer:</span> School maths is <strong>not</strong> the real thing!!! School maths is - as a rule of thumb - mathematics stripped of its beauty and soul, diminished to a set of dry rules.</p>
<p>Mathematics+ is not a collection of random, meaningless rules which you must obey blindly. Yes, there are rules in maths+. However - as strange as it may sound - these rules are not there to restrict you but to set you free. Maths+ is a creative art like music. Musicians choose and combine sounds to compose harmonious melodies. Mathematicians (programmers) put together expressions written in mathematics or some programming language to find solutions for fascinating problems. (If you have an objection to mathematical problems being fascinating <a href="#interesting-problems">read a few paragraphs later</a>.)</p>
<p>The analogy can go even further. In music, there are many - unlimited - possible combinations of sounds; however, a musician should respect some rules to produce melodic tunes and avoid discord. Similarly, there are limitless ways of putting together expressions, while a mathematician (programmer) needs to follow specific rules to reach solutions that make sense and avoid contradictions. In both cases, the purpose of any rules is only to provide a guiding framework which guarantees that the result will be orderly and beautiful.</p>
<p>Ultimately, maths+ is fun because it is creative, and it is creative because it is about solving problems. Occasionally it may be possible to find solutions by learning some rules by heart and then following them mechanically. Yet, as you should already know, especially if you have trouble with maths, this strategy does not get you very far. Imagination, creativity and insight are necessary to choose and combine the rules which are appropriate for a particular problem.</p>
<p>Rote learning and application of rules without understanding is not only boring but also a waste of time and energy. Why bother to do something which computers can do both faster and more reliably? What computers cannot do is decide on their own which rules to use. A programmer is required to tell them what to do. In other words, it’s impossible to build machines which would replace programmers and the same holds for mathematicians. There is even a theorem that proves it!! And I refer to mathematicians of all ages and levels, not just quirky university professors but also students and generally anyone who takes mathematics seriously.</p>
<h2 id="curiosity-beauty-utility">Curiosity, beauty, utility</h2>
<p id="interesting-problems">
If you believe that mathematical problems are dull and pointless, stop whatever you are doing, and first look in front of you at the computer you are using. Then look around you to your house, furniture, maybe streets and cars. Finally, consider all the scientific knowledge and the technology that has sprung from it, e.g. electricity. In short, human civilisation as you know it wouldn’t exist without mathematics. If you believe that human civilisation is dull, then what can I say? You have just been born on the wrong planet.
</p>
<p>It is possible to argue that what human civilisation has achieved is not very impressive: we still kill each other and are ready to destroy the planet. However, what is responsible for this mess is selfishness and a lack of compassion, not maths+. I am not trying to repeat the usual argument that maths+ is just a tool, and everything depends on how you use it. I wish to go further and point out that although mathematics+ is a brilliant tool for solving technical problems, it can do little - if anything at all - to increase human kindness. This is the only fault I can find with maths+: it can only find answers about what can be measured. Love and compassion, on the other hand, are immeasurable.</p>
<p>And yet, for anyone ready to look deeper, mathematics+ can point to something beyond measure: order and harmony. The world around us - and even worse within us - may be chaotic, but maths+ is orderly (provided it is well written). I am not talking about the process of coming up with a solution; this is bound to be messy; creation does not follow fixed, predetermined patterns. However, the final results of maths+ can be orderly, even beautiful. It is not the kind of order that drags you down, inflexible and without imagination. It is the order that you find in nature and makes you wonder and marvel at the intelligence with which everything has been arranged. It is like a work of art which aims to awake in you a sense of harmony and beauty.</p>
<p>Of course, taste in art is subjective, and maths+ may not be the way of expression and creativity that suits you better. Nevertheless, I would encourage you to explore it and keep your doors open. Modern culture depends more and more on maths+. Understanding its twists can help you acquire skills which will allow you to navigate this culture more easily, comprehend its advantages and weakness, and hopefully contribute to making it better. (After all, maths+ is slowly creeping in almost all aspects of human life. Many people who had thought that they had gotten rid of it after school, find it again unexpectedly in front of them.)</p>
<p>You may think that: “All this is alright, but maths+ is not for me. It is only for people with talent.” Well, we are here to prove to you that this is a myth. Maths+ requires no particular gift other than what is present in every human being: the capacity to abstract, that is, to ignore details and focus on common aspects. You may not realise it, but you are an expert in abstraction already. It is the basis of al languages, and you use it all the time when you speak. For example, instead of having a different name for every single dog or table, you abstract and generalise, putting all sufficiently similar things into groups and using a word such as ‘dog’ or ‘table’ for any member of the group. That’s how mathematics+ also works. It just has its own peculiar words and syntax, like any other language, and all you need is someone to explain to you what they mean.</p>
